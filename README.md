# Object-detection-using-machine-learning-and-yolo
This project utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm to detect and track objects in real-time.

Description

This project utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm to detect and track objects in real-time. The video is captured using a laptop webcam and processed frame by frame with Python and OpenCV. The YOLO model, which is pre-trained, identifies objects, annotates them with bounding boxes, and provides labels along with detection confidence scores to indicate classification accuracy. Non-maximum suppression is employed to enhance detection accuracy.

The main aim of this project is to explore machine learning techniques used in real-time object detection and tracking, focusing on assessing the YOLO algorithm's effectiveness, especially in dynamic environments.
